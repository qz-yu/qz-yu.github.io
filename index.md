I'm a Ph.D candidate at the [Department of Astronomy at Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/). I'm interested in the cold/cool gas evolution and star formation of galaxies, as well as their circumgalactic medium (CGM). Particularly, I'm interested in the gas recycling and its connection to the star formation during the process of galaxy mergers. 

I'm an observer experienced in spectroscopic observations with radio telescopes, including [FAST](https://fast.bao.ac.cn/), [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), [GBT](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/), [IRAM-30m](https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/content-page-55-7-55-0-0-0.html), [JCMT](https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/about-jcmt/), [Parkes](https://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/). I also have experience in the spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging with the [P200/Hale telescope](https://astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html). I'm currently working on the HI and CO observations of nearby galaxy pairs selected from the SDSS-IV [MaNGA survey](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/), advised by [Prof. Taotao Fang](https://xmugalaxy.org/) at Xiamen University. I'm leading a systematic survey of HI absorption lines in low-power radio AGNs using FAST, and I will use the spatially resolved HI follow-up observations with VLA to study the origin and kinematics of the HI absorbers. In addition, I'm working with [Dr. Yong Zheng](https://yzhenggit.github.io/yongzheng/) and analyzing the data from FAST to study the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) of the Milky Way.

I'm a Ph.D candidate in the [Department of Astronomy at Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm). I'm interested in the cold/cool gas evolution and star formation of galaxies and their circumgalactic medium (CGM). In particular, I'm interested in the gas recycling and its connection to the star formation during the process of galaxy mergers. 

I'm an observer, and I'm experienced in the observations with many radio telescopes including FAST, GBT, JCMT, Parkes. I'm also familiar with the spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging with P200/Hale telescope. I'm currently working on the HI and CO observations of nearby galaxy pairs selected from MaNGA. In addition, I'm working with Dr. Yong Zheng and analyzing the data from FAST to study the high-velocity clouds (HVC) of the Milky Way.

I'm a Ph.D candidate in the [Department of Astronomy at Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/). I'm interested in the cold/cool gas evolution and star formation of galaxies and their circumgalactic medium (CGM). Particularly, I'm interested in the gas recycling and its connection to the star formation during the process of galaxy mergers. 

I'm an observer experienced in spectroscopic observations with many radio telescopes, including [FAST](https://fast.bao.ac.cn/), [GBT](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/), [JCMT](https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/about-jcmt/), [Parkes](https://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/). I'm also familiar with the spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging with the [P200/Hale telescope](https://astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html). I'm currently working on the HI and CO observations of nearby galaxy pairs selected from [MaNGA survey](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/), advised by [Prof. Taotao Fang](https://xmugalaxy.org/) at Xiamen University. In addition, I'm working with [Dr. Yong Zheng](https://yzhenggit.github.io/yongzheng/) and analyzing the data from FAST to study the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) of the Milky Way.

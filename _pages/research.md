## HI Observations of MaNGA Major Merger Pairs

The role of HI content in galaxy interactions is still under debate. To study the HI content of galaxy pairs at different merging stages, we compile a sample of 66 major-merger galaxy pairs and 433 control galaxies from the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. In this study, we adopt kinematic asymmetry as a new effective indicator to describe the merging stage of galaxy pairs. We obtain the HI gas properties from observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and archival data of the HI-MaNGA survey. We present the detection of 6 HI emission and 1 HI absorption lines with FAST. Using these data, we investigated the differences of $f_{\text{HI}}$, SFR, and $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$ between the pair and control samples. Our results suggest that the HI gas fraction of major-merger pairs on average is marginally decreased by $\sim 17\%$ relative to isolated galaxies, implying mild HI depletion during galaxy interactions. Compared to isolated galaxies, pre-passage paired galaxies have similar $f_{\text{HI}}$, SFR and $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$, while pairs during pericentric passage have moderately decreased $f_{\text{HI}}$ ($-0.18\pm0.07$ dex) and significantly enhanced SFR ($0.29\pm0.11$ dex), $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$ ($0.44\pm0.12$ dex). When approaching the apocenter, paired galaxies show marginally decreased $f_{\text{HI}}$ ($-0.07\pm0.05$ dex) and comparable SFR ($-0.02\pm0.09$ dex), $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$ ($0.05\pm0.08$ dex). We propose the marginally detected HI depletion may originate from the gas consumption in fuelling the enhanced $\rm H_2$ reservoir of galaxy pairs. The newly detected HI absorber ($N_{\rm HI} \sim 4.7 \times 10^{21} \text{ cm}^{-2}$) may reveal the infalling gas and the triggering of AGN.

The role of HI content in galaxy interactions is still under debate. To study the HI content of galaxy pairs at different merging stages, we compile a sample of 66 major-merger galaxy pairs and 433 control galaxies from the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. In this study, we adopt kinematic asymmetry as a new effective indicator to describe the merging stage of galaxy pairs. With archival data from the HI-MaNGA survey and new observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), we investigate the differences in HI gas fraction ($f_{\text{HI}}$), star formation rate (SFR), and HI star formation efficiency ($\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$) between the pair and control samples. Our results suggest that the HI gas fraction of major-merger pairs on average is marginally decreased by $\sim 15\%$ relative to isolated galaxies, implying mild HI depletion during galaxy interactions. Compared to isolated galaxies, pre-passage paired galaxies have similar $f_{\text{HI}}$, SFR and $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$, while pairs during pericentric passage have weakly decreased $f_{\text{HI}}$ ($-0.10\pm0.05$ dex), significantly enhanced SFR ($0.42\pm0.11$ dex) and $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$ ($0.48\pm0.12$ dex). When approaching the apocenter, paired galaxies show marginally decreased $f_{\text{HI}}$ ($-0.05\pm0.04$ dex), comparable SFR ($0.04\pm0.06$ dex) and $\rm SFE_{\rm HI}$ ($0.08\pm0.08$ dex). We propose the marginally detected HI depletion may originate from the gas consumption in fuelling the enhanced $\rm H_2$ reservoir of galaxy pairs. In addition, new FAST observations also reveal an HI absorber ($N_{\rm HI} \sim 4.7 \times 10^{21} \text{ cm}^{-2}$), which may suggest gas infalling and the triggering of AGN activity.

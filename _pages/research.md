##HI Observations of MaNGA Major Merger Pairs

The role of H{\sc i} content in galaxy interactions is still under debate. To study the \hi\ content of galaxy pairs at different merging stages, we compile a sample of 66 major-merger galaxy pairs and 433 control galaxies from the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. In this study, we adopt kinematic asymmetry as a new effective indicator to describe the merging stage of galaxy pairs. We obtain the \hi\ gas properties from observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and archival data of the HI-MaNGA survey. We present the detection of 6 \hi\ emission and 1 \hi\ absorption lines with FAST. Using these data, we investigated the differences of $f_\text{\hi}$, SFR, and \sfe\ between the pair and control samples. Our results suggest that the \hi\ gas fraction of major-merger pairs on average is marginally decreased by $\sim 17\%$ relative to isolated galaxies, implying mild \hi\ depletion during galaxy interactions. Compared to isolated galaxies, pre-passage paired galaxies have similar $f_{\text{\hi}}$, SFR and \sfe, while pairs during pericentric passage have moderately decreased $f_{\text{\hi}}$ ($-0.18\pm0.07$ dex) and significantly enhanced SFR ($0.29\pm0.11$ dex), \sfe\ ($0.44\pm0.12$ dex). When approaching the apocenter, paired galaxies show marginally decreased $f_{\text{\hi}}$ ($-0.07\pm0.05$ dex) and comparable SFR ($-0.02\pm0.09$ dex), \sfe\ ($0.05\pm0.08$ dex). We propose the marginally detected \hi\ depletion may originate from the gas consumption in fuelling the enhanced $\rm H_2$ reservoir of galaxy pairs. The newly detected \hi\ absorber ($\nhi \sim 4.7 \times 10^{21} \text{ cm}^{-2}$) may reveal the infalling gas and the triggering of AGN.
